      <p style="font-size: 2rem">
        TENGU is a competitive game of strategy and chance where two players
        face-off to see who can earn more points. A player begins their turn by
        drawing one card. Each card has an associated point value, and may have
        additional effects, or a spell that the player can use if they wish.
        Read the cards carefully to make sure you understand each card's effects
        and spells. After drawing a card, you can decide to draw another card,
        or "hold". If you decide to "hold", your current score will be added to
        your total score, and the next player's turn will begin. A player's turn
        continues until they decide to "hold" or until they draw the TENGU!
        Beware of the TENGU! If you draw the TENGU card, you lose all points you
        earned this round and your turn is over. You can choose how many rounds 
        you wish to play or an amount of points the game will be played to. The 
        player with the most points at the end of the game wins! The player who 
        loses suffers the curse of the TENGU!

        Each of the cards in this game is inspired by a Japanese folktale. The
        effects of each card are thematically based on the content of the
        stories. Below is a short summary of the story from each card. I
        encourage you to do a Google search to find more details on any story
        you are interested in!
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>TENGU</b>: A typically malevolent, supernatural, human-like creature
        who appears in many different folktales. The nature of his magical
        abilities and personality often differ from story to story, but his red
        skin and long nose are found in most typical depictions.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Momotarou</b>: The story of a boy found in a peach by an elderly
        couple, who grows into a strong warrior and befriends a dog, pheasant,
        and monkey to vanquish demons who had been plaguing the countryside.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Urashima Tarou</b>: The story of a young fisherman who saves a turtle
        and is rewarded by being taken to a magical palace below the sea. Time
        sits still in the palace and when he returns to land, he realizes that
        hundreds of years have passed.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Kintarou</b>: The story of a boy who is friends with the creatures of
        the forest and famously beats a bear in a sumo wrestling bout.
        Supposedly based on the legend of an actual historical figure who was
        known to be a great samurai warrior.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Monkey-Crab Quarrel</b>: A famous folktale about a story of vengence
        after a monkey's unjust assault on a crab. The monkey is paid back twice
        over for his foul deeds against the crab.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Bunbuku Chagama</b>: The story of a magical tanuki who shapeshifts
        into an ornamented tea kettle in order to try to repay a favor to a
        Buddhist priest.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Sanmai no Ofuda</b>: A young priest is sent to the mountain to
        collect some flowers. He ends up encountering the demon-witch, ONIBABA.
        He makes use of three protective "ofuda" (sacred paper charms) in his
        attempt to escape from her.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Kobu-tori Jiisan</b>: An old man with a lump hanging from his cheek
        gets stuck outside in a storm one night, and encounters a gathering of
        dancing monsters. He dances for the monsters, who remove the lump on his
        face. Another old man with a lump on his face attempts to receive the
        same favor, but ends up with different results.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Kamo-tori Gonbei</b>: The hunter, Gonbei, is always looking for
        tricks to capture more ducks with less effort. One day he schemes a way
        to catch 100 ducks at once, but things quickly end up getting carried
        away.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Warashibe Chouja</b>: The story of a poor young man who ends up

        <br />
        <b>Issunboushi</b>: A childless couple is blessed with a child who
        happens to be only an inch-tall. He grows into an ambitious young man,
        though no larger than the size of a thumb. He works hard, and his
        bravery and loyalty are eventually rewarded when a magic spell turns him
        into a full-sized adult.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Tsuru no Ongaeshi</b>: A poor elderly man saves a crane from a trap.
        Some days later, a young woman shows up at his house and begins to make
        fine garments for him. The girl continues to work on the condition that
        he never peeks in the room as she's working. It turns out the young
        woman is actually the crane who is using her own feathes to make fabric
        to repay the favor to the man.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Ikkyuu-san</b>: Ikkyuu-san is a character who appears in a variety of
        Japanese folktales made for children. He was an actual historical
        figure, who was a renowned as a Buddhist monk and poet. Folktales of
        young Ikkyuu-san typically depict him as mischievous and clever, usually
        using some trick to outwit the adults around him.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Omusubi Kororin</b>: An elderly peasant accidentally drops his
        riceball lunch down a hole where mice are gleefully singing and making
        mochi. He is rewarded for his good nature toward the mice with treasure.
        His greedy nextdoor neighbor attempts to receive treasure from the mice
        as well, but is punished for his greediness.

<!-- TENGU is a competitive game of strategy and chance where two players face-off to see who can earn more points. 
  A player begins their turn by drawing one card. Each card has an associated point value, and may have additional effects, or a spell that 
  the player can use if they wish. Read the cards carefully to make sure you understand each card's effects and spells.
  After drawing a card, you can decide to draw another card, or "hold". If you decide to "hold", your current score will be added to your total score,
  and the next player's turn will begin. A player's turn continues until they decide to "hold" or until they draw the TENGU! Beware of the TENGU! If you draw
  the TENGU card, you lose all points you earned this round and your turn is over. The game continues for five or ten rounds (as determined by user settings),
  and the player who has the most points after the final round wins! The player who loses suffers the cuse of the TENGU!
